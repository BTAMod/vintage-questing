# Vintage Questing

A questing mod for Better than Adventure 7.2!

*Currently only supports modyifng the questbook through code, but eventually an in-game editor and loading from (and saving to) JSON files will be implemented.*

*The questbook can be opened by default using the `GRAVE` key, this can be changed in the in-game options menu.*

**Examples of chapters, quests, tasks and rewards are [here!](https://github.com/MartinSVK12/vintage-questing/blob/main/src/main/resources/example.md)**
